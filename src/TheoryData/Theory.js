      defination: `With Dijkstra's Algorithm, you can find the shortest path between nodes in a graph.Particularly, you can find the shortest path from a node(called the "source node") to all other nodes in the graph, producing a shortest- path tree.
      This algorithm is used in GPS devices to find the shortest path between the current location and the destination.It has broad applications in industry, specially in domains that require modeling networks.
